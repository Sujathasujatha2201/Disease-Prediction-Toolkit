# 🩺 Disease Prediction Toolkit

This project predicts the presence of heart disease using different Machine Learning models.  
It compares *Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest* and evaluates them with multiple metrics to find the best performing model.

---

## 📊 Project Overview
Early disease prediction helps in timely treatment and better patient care.  
In this project, we used a *Heart Disease Dataset* to train different ML models and evaluate them.  
The toolkit can be extended to predict other diseases in the future.

## 📂 Dataset
- Dataset: heart.csv  
- Source: UCI Machine Learning
Repository (Heart Disease Dataset)  
- Features: Age, Sex, Blood Pressure, Cholesterol, Heart Rate, etc.  
- Target: Presence (1) or Absence (0) of heart disease
