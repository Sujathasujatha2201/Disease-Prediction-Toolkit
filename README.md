# Disease Prediction Toolkit

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a *Disease Prediction Toolkit* that uses machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, etc.) to predict the likelihood of diseases such as *Heart Disease* based on health data.  

## 🎯 Objectives
- Learn ML fundamentals and data preprocessing.  
- Train and test ML models on healthcare datasets.  
- Evaluate models with accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC.  
- Visualize results with confusion matrix and ROC curve.  

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- Python  
- Scikit-learn  
- Pandas, Numpy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  

## 📂 Dataset
We use the *Heart Disease dataset* (heart.csv).  
Source: Kaggle / UCI Repository.  

## 📊 Steps in the Project
1. Preprocess the dataset (handle missing values, encode categorical data, scaling).  
2. Train ML models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest).  
3. Evaluate models with metrics.  
4. Visualize results.  

## 🚀 How to Run
- Open the notebook (.ipynb) in *Google Colab*.  
- Upload the dataset (heart.csv).  
- Run all cells to train and test models.
